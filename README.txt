plugin.video.myvevo
================

This is a forked version of plugin.video.myvevo from learningit to
re-add compatibility with KODI Jarvis and make inputstream optional.
For both features script.module.youtube.dl is needed and should be 
installed automatically from the main KODI-Repo.
The addon name is not changed (atleast for now) so everytime a new 
version from learningit arrives in the KODI-Repo this addon will be 
overwritten (This will most likely not happen in Jarvis). 
If I have time I will update (my minimal changes, most of the work is
done by learningit) the fork if a new version comes available.
